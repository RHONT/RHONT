Hi, my nickname RHONT, and my name is Belykh Evgeny. I am from Saint-Petersburg.

I’m interested in Java, Spring, SQL, Hibernate, JSP

I am currently studying spring and everything related to it, trying to understand its need for development.

My repository contains two full-fledged projects. 
The first is a game "Story about a knight". 
The second is an improvised database for a service that serves printing presses. 
There is also homework from Java courses

It will be nice to get into the development of an interesting project where I can grow as a software developer.
